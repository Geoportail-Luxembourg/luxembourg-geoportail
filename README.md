## Geoportail Luxembourg WebApp

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

## Quickstart

To start local dev environment with HMR support:

```
$ npm run start
```

## üîß Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes, will run `npm run dev`
- `dev` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `build-only` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory, but without type checking
- `test`, `test:unit`, `test:unit:ci` runs your test suite with Vitest. See _Unit testing_ section
- `test:e2e`, `test:e2e:ci`, `test:e2e:dev` see _End to end testing_ section
- `report` create code coverage report for e2e tests
- `lint`, `lint:js`, `lint:prettier` runs the linter for your project
- `format` format the code with prettier (write mode)
- `prepare` runs `husky install` command

## üíâ Test

### Unit testing

- `npm run test` launch all Vitests UTs, is an alias for `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run test:unit` will launch all Vitests UTs, will watch for any changes in both src files and tests files
- `npm run test:unit:ci` to be used by CI only | Coverage reports are located in: `/coverage/index.html`

### End to end testing with Cypress

For e2e tests, the code is instrumented with the Istanbul library to obtain resulting code coverage. The dev test server is launched with the env var `INSRUMENT_COVERAGE=true`

- `test:e2e` will launch e2e tests and opens Cypress UI. You need to build the app before using this command with `npm run build-only -- --mode=e2e`. This will test the app built for production (with css minification, images src optimization using base64, ...)
- `test:e2e:ci` This will run tests in command line only on a dev build (no need to build the app). Used by ci workflow.
- `test:e2e:dev` will launch e2e tests and opens Cypress UI. This command will launch a vite server in dev mode, there is no need to build the app.
- `report` after running any of the above e2e test suites, the command `npm run report` will display the code coverage report from the data created by e2e tests in `/.nyc_output/out.json`. This recipe is used in the CI workflow.

‚ö†Ô∏è `test:e2e:ci` command should launch tests on the generated build production. For now, it launches the vite dev server, otherwise the code coverage report is not generated and the next ci command `npx nyc report` will trigger an error.

## üì¶ Build as a lib for integration (in geoportal v3)

In order to use the new Lux components made with Vuejs as an external dep, follow steps below.

### Build the lib

In the project **luxembourg-geoportail**, build the app as library with this command:

```
$ npx vite build --config vite-dist.config.ts
```

This will generate an export of all available **Vue components** and **State persistor services** that can be used in a independant application (eg. geoportalv3 legacy app).

To see what are the components exported, check the `lib.ts` that is the entry point for the build.

‚ö†Ô∏è This build does not contain **Vue.js** dependencies. For this reason, Vue.js must be included in the application that will include the lib.

### Import the lib in another app

You can include the built lib multiple ways in the `package.json`:

- using `npm link`
- using `git`

```js
// Example of a package.json
// including the lib with git and a specific branch (GSLUX-602-IntegrationV3)
"packages": {
    "": {
      "name": "luxgeo_test_inte",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "license": "ISC",
      "dependencies": {
        "luxembourg-geoportail": "git://github.com/Geoportail-Luxembourg/luxembourg-geoportail.git#GSLUX-602-IntegrationV3"
        // or "https://github.com/Geoportail-Luxembourg/luxembourg-geoportail.git#GSLUX-602-IntegrationV3"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        // ...
      }
    }
}
```

### Install Vue.js

Don't forget to also include **Vue.js** as a dependency.

```
$ npm install -D vue
```

If using the **Webpack bundler** (as it is the case in geoportalv3), install `vue-loader` and update the webpack configuration file. Add alias to **Vue.js** to make the lib work with the current Vue instance.

https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/#manual-setup

```
$ npm install -D vue-loader
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require('vue-loader')

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...
      {
        test: /\.vue$/,
        loader: 'vue-loader', // <= Add the rule for Vue
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.vue', '.json'],
    alias: {
      vue$: 'vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js', // <= Add the alias for Vue
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    new VueLoaderPlugin(), // <= Don't forget the plugin for Vue loader
  ],
}
```

### Make assets available

Assets like translations are imported using an absolute path. Make them accessible via the right path. For geoportalv3, we choose to copy the assets directory with the `CopyPlugin`:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
const path = require('path')
const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require('vue-loader')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new VueLoaderPlugin(),
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            'node_modules',
            'luxembourg-geoportail',
            'bundle',
            'assets'
          ),
          to: 'assets',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
}
```
